% This is where Assessors will be looking for signs of success and for evidence of thorough and systematic 
% evaluation as discussed in Section 8.3. Sample output, tables of timings and photographs of workstation screens,
% oscilloscope traces or circuit boards may be included. A graph that does not indicate confidence intervals will 
% generally leave a professional scientist with a negative impression.

% As with code, voluminous examples of sample output are usually best left to appendices or omitted altogether.
% There are some obvious questions which this chapter will address. How many of the original goals were achieved? 
% Were they proved to have been achieved? Did the program, hardware, or theory really work?
% Assessors are well aware that large programs will very likely include some residual bugs. It should always be 
% possible to demonstrate that a program works in simple cases and it is instructive to demonstrate how close it 
% is to working in a really ambitious case.
